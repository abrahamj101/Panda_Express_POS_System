# Project 3 Team 3b

Howdy!

Welcome to Team 3B's Panda Express page! This overview explains the structure of this repository, as well as the functionality of our web app itself.

## Repository Structure

All the core functionality of our website is in the folder `my-app`. Here's a list of the major elements within this folder:

### 1. backend
`my-app/backend`  
**Purpose**: This folder contains the Node.js modules and routing functionality that manage database integration and routing. The modules and packages are visible in `/backend/node-modules`. The routing files for several functions in our website are visible in `/backend/routes`. The central file is `index.js`, which integrates all the other modules and routing files.

### 2. Components
`my-app/src/components`  
**Purpose**: The main purpose of the Components folder is to hold the front-end functionality and user interface of several in-page components of the app. You can find the React.js pages for each of our components, organized into folders for each feature.

### 3. Pages
`my-app/src/pages`  
**Purpose**: The Pages folder contains all the front-end React.js code for each page in our app. This includes all the pages within each view (Cashier, Manager, Customer, and the Menu Board).

### 4. Styles
`my-app/src/styles`  
**Purpose**: The Styles folder contains all the stylesheets for each of our components and pages, organized into folders for each feature or page.

### 5. Code Documentation
`/docs`  
**Purpose**: Shows all the JSDoc HTML files, which document each page and function in our JS code.

### 6. SCRUM Documentation
`Documentation`  
**Purpose**: This folder contains all the documentation of team communications, including SCRUM meeting minutes, expert surveys, product and sprint burndown charts, and task sheets. You can view all the information for Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and Sprint 3 in their corresponding subfolders.

## App Structure

On the landing page of our app, users can navigate to several different pages, including the customer ordering view, or to view the menu board itself. To order, click "Order Now", then select the categories and food items you would like to order. When you are ready, press "Add to Cart" at the bottom of the page. To view your cart, click on the cart icon at the top right of the page, where you can see each item you have ordered. When you are ready to check out, click the blue "Checkout" button at the bottom of the "View Cart" sidebar, and enter your name, email, and credit card information. Then press "Checkout".

For cashiers, log in using the "Sign in with Google" button at the top right of the page. To place an order, go through the same steps you would in the customer interface. You can also view your order history from your account by clicking the "Order History" button in the header.

For managers, log in using the "Sign in with Google" button at the top right of the page. You will then see a 'Manager' button on the landing page. Click this button to enter the manager page. To view reports, click on the "Reports" button and select which report you would like to view (Product Usage, Sales, XReport, or ZReport). Additionally, you can view inventory status, add, or remove inventory items. Similarly, you can also manage food items, menu items, and employee info. You can also view order history from this page.

For accessibility needs, click the orange icon at the bottom right. You can see the options to zoom in, zoom out, enable text-to-speech, translate the page, or enable high contrast mode. You can also view today's weather on the landing page.

We have integrated the Google Translate API for page translations, as well as the OAuth2 API for the login functionality, and the WeatherAPI for the modal at the top of the landing page, which shows the weather.

### Reports
- **Product Usage Report**: Provides insights into the usage patterns of different food items.
- **Sales Report**: Displays detailed sales data, including item-wise and total sales.
- **XReport**: Focused on specific financial and operational metrics.
- **ZReport**: Similar to the XReport but with different metrics and structure.
- **XReport Payments**: Provides a breakdown of payment methods used during transactions.
- **ZReport Payments**: Similar to the XReport Payments but covers additional payment metrics.

## Accessibility Features
- **Text-to-Speech**: Allows the content of the page to be read aloud to users, providing a hands-free experience.
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhances readability for users with visual impairments by providing a higher contrast between text and background.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Enables users to adjust the size of the page content for better visibility.
- **Google Translate API**: Offers multilingual support by translating the page content into various languages.
- **Weather Widget**: Displays the current weather on the landing page for the user’s convenience.
